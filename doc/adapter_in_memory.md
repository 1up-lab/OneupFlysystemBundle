# Use the MemoryAdapter

This adapter keeps the filesystem solely in the memory.

```yml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        memory_adapter:
            memory: ~
```

For more details on the other parameters, take a look at the [Flysystem documentation](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/adapter/in-memory/).
