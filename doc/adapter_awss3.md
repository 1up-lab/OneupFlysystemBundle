# Use the AwsS3 adapter

There are two AwsS3 adapters that you can use with this bundle. Below is the configuration for AwsS3v3 and AwsS3v2 adapters.

## AwsS3v3

In order to use the AwsS3v3 adapter, you first need to create
a client object defined as a service. This Flysystem adapter
works with the [aws/aws-sdk-php](https://packagist.org/packages/aws/aws-sdk-php) package version 3 and above. 
This version requires you to use the "v4" of the signature.

```yml
services:
    acme.s3_client:
        class: Aws\S3\S3Client
        arguments:
            -
                version: '2006-03-01' # or 'latest'
                region: "region-id" # 'eu-central-1' for example
                credentials:
                    key: "s3-key"
                    secret: "s3-secret"
```

Set this service as the value of the `client` key in the `oneup_flysystem` configuration.

```yml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        acme.flysystem_adapter:
            awss3v3:
                client: acme.s3_client
                bucket: ~
                prefix: ~
```

For more details on the other parameters, take a look at the [Flysystem documentation](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/adapter/aws-s3-v3/).

## AwsS3v2

In order to use the AwsS3v2 adapter, you first need to create
a client object defined as a service. This Flysystem adapter
works with the [aws/aws-sdk-php](https://packagist.org/packages/aws/aws-sdk-php) package version ~2.7.

```yml
services:
    acme.s3_client:
        class: Aws\S3\S3Client
        factory_class: Aws\S3\S3Client
        factory_method: factory
        arguments:
            -
                key: "s3-key"
                secret: "s3-secret"
```

For the China (Beijing) and EU (Frankfurt) regions, Amazon S3 supports only Signature Version 4, and AWS SDKs use this signature version to authenticate requests. See the [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html).

You should add some extras configs options :

```yml
services:
    acme.s3_client:
        class: Aws\S3\S3Client
        factory_class: Aws\S3\S3Client
        factory_method: factory
        arguments:
            -
                key: "s3-key"
                secret: "s3-secret"
                signature: "v4"
                region: "region-id" # 'eu-central-1' for example
```

Set this service as the value of the `client` key in the `oneup_flysystem` configuration.

```yml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        acme.flysystem_adapter:
            awss3v2:
                client: acme.s3_client
                bucket: ~
                prefix: ~
```

For more details on the other parameters, take a look at the [Flysystem documentation](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/adapter/aws-s3-v2/).

## Additional parameters
Use `options` config to pass additional parameters to AWS.

### Example use case

Sending files to S3 bucket owned by another AWS account.
In this situation default `ACL` value, which is `private`, prevents bucket owner from viewing the file.

To allow bucket owner full control over an object use below config example:

```yml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        acme.flysystem_adapter:
            awss3v3:
                client: acme.s3_client
                bucket: foo
                prefix: ~
                options:
                    ACL: bucket-owner-full-control
```
