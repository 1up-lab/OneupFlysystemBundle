OneupFlysystemBundle
====================

The OneupFlysystemBundle provides a [Flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) integration for your Symfony2 projects.

> Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction which allows you to easily swap out a local filesystem for a remote one.


Credit where credit is due
--------------------------

Due to the similiarities between Flysystem and Gaufrette, this bundle is *heavily* inspired by the beautifully crafted [GaufretteBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle). Props to the devs at [KnpLab](http://knplabs.com/)!

Reporting an issue or a feature request
---------------------------------------

Issues and feature requests are tracked in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle/issues).

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project
built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it
and following some steps.
